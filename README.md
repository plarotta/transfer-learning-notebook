# Transfer learning for computer vision
In this short notebook I show how transfer learning can be used to train a classifier for a new task with minimal training and a relatively small dataset. I show how to fine-tune ResNet, EfficientNet, and ViT architectures to the task of identifying cat/dog images.

**Note:** the reported training accuracies in the notebook are not quite right (small implementation bug in my accuracy calculation), and I have not gotten around to going back and fixing it.
